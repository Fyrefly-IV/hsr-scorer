# Honkai Scorer

Small web application allowing Honkai Star Rail fans to compare game characters with each other.

## How to setup development environment

I highly recommend using Node Version Manager (nvm), otheriwse check `.nvmrc` and make sure your Node's version is matching it.

1.  Install dependencies `npm install`
2.  Start dev server `npm run dev`

A coupe of words for those, who'd like to contribute!

1.  Make sure to follow ESLint rules, try not to ignore them, please.
2.  Try to avoid big commits and split changes across multiple commits or maybe even pull requests.
